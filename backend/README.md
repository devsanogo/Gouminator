Backend
========================

Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

## Dependencies

* [Nelmios-cors-bundle](https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioCorsBundle) to send Cross-Origin Resource Sharing headers with ACL-style per-URL configuration.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stommy11/Gouminator.git
cd backend
composer update
```

## Development server

Run ` php bin/console server:start localhost:4001` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4001/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

All libraries and bundles included in the Symfony Standard Edition are
released under the MIT or BSD license.

Enjoy!
